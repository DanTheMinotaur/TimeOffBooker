# Timero
========

The purpose of the project is to build a booking application which will keep track of employees and the time off they are taking as well as give the employees information about the company.
The app makes use of the calandarific API to sync public holiday days and news.org API to get news data. 
Users of the app are able to log in and submit dates to be booked off, these are then sent for approval to an associated manager. A user can also book in sick days
A manager is a user who can approve employees time off, once they are associated with them. They can also submit time off if they request approvals.
An Admin user is able to do all actions of a manager, in addition, to add, edit and delete company holidays. Add users with different levels and assign manager permissions over other users.
